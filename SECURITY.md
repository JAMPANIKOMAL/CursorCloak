## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CursorCloak seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [INSERT EMAIL HERE] or by creating a private security advisory if enabled on the repository.

You should expect to receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Security Best Practices for Users

Since CursorCloak interacts with system-level features (mouse cursor, global hooks), we recommend the following:

1.  **Only download releases from the official GitHub repository.**
2.  **Verify the hash/checksum** of the downloaded files if provided.
3.  **Run as Administrator** is required for functionality, but be aware of the implications of running any software with elevated privileges.
