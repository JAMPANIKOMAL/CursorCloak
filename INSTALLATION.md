## üõ°Ô∏è Windows SmartScreen Warning

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Windows may show a SmartScreen warning because this is a new application without a digital signature.

### If you see this message:
```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
```

### How to bypass safely:
1. **Click "More info"** (small text link)
2. **Click "Run anyway"** button that appears
3. The installer will start normally

### Why this happens:
- New applications without expensive code signing certificates trigger this
- This is normal and safe - the app is clean and built from open source
- Once enough users install it, Windows will recognize it as safe
