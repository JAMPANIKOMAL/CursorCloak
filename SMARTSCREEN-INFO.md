# Windows SmartScreen Information

## What is Windows SmartScreen?

Windows SmartScreen is a security feature that helps protect your PC by checking files and apps downloaded from the internet. When you download and run CursorCloak, you might see a SmartScreen warning because:

1. **The application is not digitally signed** - Digital code signing certificates cost hundreds of dollars annually, which is not feasible for free open-source projects
2. **Low download frequency** - New applications need to build reputation over time
3. **Not from Microsoft Store** - Sideloaded applications trigger additional scrutiny

## SmartScreen Mitigation Improvements

We've enhanced the application metadata to reduce SmartScreen warnings:

- **Enhanced Publisher Information**: Detailed company and product information
- **Professional Version Metadata**: Complete version info with copyright and trademarks  
- **Descriptive File Information**: Clear descriptions of what the application does
- **Legal Information**: Proper copyright and licensing information
- **Contact Information**: Direct links to support and source code

## Alternative Solutions

### If you prefer not to bypass SmartScreen:

1. **Compile from Source**: Build the application yourself using Visual Studio 2022
2. **Wait for Reputation**: As more users download and use CursorCloak, SmartScreen warnings will decrease
3. **Use Windows Subsystem for Linux**: Run a Linux cursor utility instead

## Building from Source (Advanced)

To build a signed version yourself:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JAMPANIKOMAL/CursorCloak.git`
2. Open in Visual Studio 2022
3. Build in Release configuration
4. Optionally sign with your own certificate
