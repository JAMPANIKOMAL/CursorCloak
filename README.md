# Using the enhanced build script (recommended)
.\scripts\build.ps1                                      # Basic build
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Clean                              # Clean and build
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Clean -AllPackages                 # Build with all packages

# Manual build commands
dotnet clean --configuration Release
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Create self-contained deployment
dotnet publish src\CursorCloak.UI\CursorCloak.UI.csproj --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained true --output .\publish\ui\

# Test the built application
.\scripts\test.ps1

# Create installer (requires InnoSetup)
# Compile scripts\setup.iss with InnoSetup Compiler
```

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### Using the Installer

2. Choose installation directory (default: `C:\Program Files\CursorCloak`)
3. Select optional shortcuts (desktop, start menu)
4. Complete installation
5. Launch automatically if selected

### Manual Installation

2. Ensure all .dll files are in the same directory as the .exe
3. Run as administrator for first-time setup
4. Configure startup options through the UI

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

### Using the Uninstaller (Recommended)
CursorCloak v1.0.1+ includes a professional uninstaller that completely removes all traces:

1. **Windows Settings**: Go to Settings → Apps → CursorCloak → Uninstall
2. **Control Panel**: Programs and Features → CursorCloak → Uninstall
3. **Start Menu**: CursorCloak folder → "Uninstall CursorCloak"

**What the uninstaller removes:**
- ✅ All application files and folders
- ✅ Windows startup registry entries
- ✅ User settings and configuration files (`%APPDATA%\CursorCloak`)
- ✅ Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts
- ✅ Stops any running instances
- ✅ Complete registry cleanup

### Manual Removal (if needed)
If using portable version or for manual cleanup:

1. **Stop the application**: Close CursorCloak completely
2. **Remove startup entry**: Run as admin: `reg delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "CursorCloak" /f`
3. **Delete application folder**: Remove the CursorCloak installation directory
4. **Remove user data**: Delete `%APPDATA%\CursorCloak` folder
5. **Remove shortcuts**: Check Desktop and Start Menu for any remaining shortcuts

## 🔧 Configuration

Settings are stored in:
```
%APPDATA%\CursorCloak\settings.json
```

Configuration options:
- **IsHidingEnabled**: Whether cursor hiding is active
- **StartWithWindows**: Launch automatically on Windows startup

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error 0xc000041d (Fatal Exception)**
- Ensure running as administrator
- Verify .NET 9.0 runtime is installed
- Check Windows Event Viewer for detailed errors

**Hotkeys Not Working**
- Check for conflicts with other applications
- Ensure application has proper focus
- Verify administrator privileges

**Cursor Won't Hide/Show**
